# Lab06Railroad
Sixth lab in CS 235, using a deque class wrapped by a stack, vector, and queue to manage a train station turntable.
Create a railroad train station that uses a central turntable and roundhouses to store and order train cars. Cars enter the train station if the turntable is empty. From the turntable cars can be moved to a "stack" roundhouse facility (LIFO) or a "queue" roundhouse facility (FIFO). Train cars exit the train station by moving from the turntable to a "vector" of outbound cars.
